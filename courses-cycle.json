And I installed it on one of my Hyper-V VMs of Ubuntu (Kubuntu), set up persistence, replication and security, and installed a GUI (<i>Another Redis Desktop Manager</i>) for it there. I also wrote shell scripts to start the replication server, and the client, passing authorization.<br />And I downloaded Docker images/containers of Redis and of the <i>Redis-Commander</i> GUI client.<br />I also created a Redis Cloud account.<br /><br />UPDATE (the next day): As the Windows version of Redis is just a port, and the instructor used a Mac, I went back and installed and configured it on my Mac. I also went and set the PATHs there, and in WSL and Kubuntu, which I hadn't done, so that I could run my shell scripts from anywhere in the terminal on those platforms.<br />I changed the bindings in the Redis config files on my Mac and Ubuntu VM, so that I was allowed to connect to those instances from the RediNav GUI in Windows. I then created connections to those in RediNav.<br />WSL already acted as 127.0.0.1, so I changed the config files there to use different ports (for the main and replication servers), so I could have and access distinct databases in Windows and WSL at the same time.<br />I also created connections to the WSL servers in RediNav.<br />And I wrote a Windows batch file to connect to the different port of the WSL main server with the Redis command line client from Windows.<br /><br />UPDATE (about a week later): I wrote a Node.js program to parse through the JSON file that I use to track my LinkedIn Learning courses, populating a Redis database by creating a Hash for each course record and its items.",

When you write an application, you have to consider the application code, frameworks, packages, and the underlying operating system itself. Using Docker allows you to encapsulate everything you need to run an application, with all its dependencies, in one nice, neat package that you can replicate on any machine or workstation, as many times as you need. In this course, Shayne Boyer and Lisa Guthrie start with the very basics of Docker, covering the concepts and practical uses, then move on to integrating Docker with Visual Studio to help you containerize your apps with just a few clicks. Finally, Shayne and Lisa show you a simple way to publish your containerized web app.",

Compare different approaches to computing the Fibonacci Sequence and learn how to visualize the problem as a directed acyclic graph.

In this final installment of \"UX Design Techniques\"—a series designed to teach you how to make your development process more user centered—learn how to use artifacts from each of the UCD techniques to help plan the implementation of your design.  Implementation planning happens at the end of the initial UCD cycle. First, you observe users, and then you create an experience map to extract pain points, goals, and personas. This gives you the information needed to do ideation exercises. After ideation, bring things back to reality by creating scenarios, which you use to build a prototype UI for planning purposes. By investing time in these UCD activities, you'll enter the development phase of your project with a much better understanding of what you need to build to delight your users. Having a set of measurable goals and a prototype interface makes it easier to plan your implementation and set interim deliverables that you know will deliver value to your users.",

It was good to get refreshed on this, since it's been a while since I used it.<br />We used the Windows Defender Firewall in the <i>Troubleshooting open firewall ports</i> lesson, which was also a good refresher for me, since I'd more recently used the McAfee Firewall to control ports.",

The instructor was too brief, in my opinion, on exception handling, and I'll give him a \"C\" on that part. (Fortunately, I've had prior good instruction and experience on/with this topic.)<br />We learned about creating Web Controls, exposing public properties of them, and registering and using them.<br />In the <i>Working with Data</i> chapter, the instructor used a <i>LocalDB</i> SQL Server database, but I wanted to use my own SQL Server instance. So I attached the provided database files to my SQL Server, and used Connection Strings to that. I had to fiddle with the Application Pool settings in IIS to use Integrated Security for the database access, so I decided to create a new Application Pool for the app and used that. But I also created a database user (using SQL Server Authentication), granting it the minimum rights necessary, and created a Connection String for that user. I then coded the app both ways (to be able to use either user).<br />We finished up with adding our User (Web) Control to the ListView (that we used to display the data), using it to insert and update data (instead of the built-in functionality).",

      "synopsis": "Explore the four domains of emotional intelligence—self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management—as defined by psychologist and author Daniel Goleman. The domains build on one another, starting with a greater awareness of self and others, and ending with the management of relationships that are critical to your personal and professional life. Learn how to become more mindful of your strengths, limitations, and the values that define them; explore ways to create space between yourself, your thoughts, and your emotions; develop awareness of how people see the world differently based on individual preferences, as well as social and environmental factors; and use awareness of self and others to work toward collaboration, innovation, and mutually beneficial relationships. This course includes videos from: Daniel Goleman, psychologist, lecturer, and science journalist Amy Cuddy, social psychologist and associate professor at Harvard Business School Susan David, psychologist at Harvard Medical School and cofounder of the Institute of Coaching Alan Alda, Emmy-winning actor, writer, and director Angie McArthur, CEO of Professional Thinking Partners Note: This course was produced by Big Think.

It is commonly used as the data format of choice in microservices, RESTful APIs, and NoSQL data stores. Knowing how to manipulate JSON is crucial knowledge for any developer.  In this course, discover how to use the Java Enterprise Edition (EE) JSON-Processing API. With its two programming models, JSON-Processing is one of the simplest ways to generate, query, and parse JSON data, and you'll find that implementing it in your projects is quick and easy. Join Alex Theedom as he covers an array of topics, including how to use both the object model and the streaming model, how to traverse a JSON structure, and how to parse JSON data using the extensive builder APIs. When you wrap up this course, you'll be ready to develop with this essential and powerful API.",

So, for example, you can run Linux utilities, like awk and grep, etc. against the Windows filesystem.<br />The instructor had us install the Remote-WSL extension in Visual Studio Code - this gave us the ability to have a remote shell into the Linux environment, and create/edit and run scripts there, right from VS Code in Windows.<br />Now back to the Learning Bash Scripting course!",

The course is primarily non-technical by design, intended for those working in business leadership positions, data science, and IT management.  Jonathan begins by describing some of the current challenges with the Internet, including existing risks and security problems such as identity management. Next, he describes how traditional online databases function, so that you have a basis for how the blockchain redesigns this function. He then describes how the blockchain becomes a potential solution for many of the existing limitations of online databases. Since the blockchain has its genesis in Bitcoin—the digital currency—he provides some background on that too.
