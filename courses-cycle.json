The instructor was too brief, in my opinion, on exception handling, and I'll give him a \"C\" on that part. (Fortunately, I've had prior good instruction and experience on/with this topic.)<br />We learned about creating Web Controls, exposing public properties of them, and registering and using them.<br />In the <i>Working with Data</i> chapter, the instructor used a <i>LocalDB</i> SQL Server database, but I wanted to use my own SQL Server instance. So I attached the provided database files to my SQL Server, and used Connection Strings to that. I had to fiddle with the Application Pool settings in IIS to use Integrated Security for the database access, so I decided to create a new Application Pool for the app and used that. But I also created a database user (using SQL Server Authentication), granting it the minimum rights necessary, and created a Connection String for that user. I then coded the app both ways (to be able to use either user).<br />We finished up with adding our User (Web) Control to the ListView (that we used to display the data), using it to insert and update data (instead of the built-in functionality).",

I went ahead and used my prior installation of it, since I had recently updated it (to a newer version than was included in this local installation).<br />In this local installation, I had taken care to specify a different port than was used in the container, to avoid conflicts.

Learn how to manage the placement of those widgets on the GUI and make them react to user behavior with event-driven code. The final chapter takes you through the entire start-to-finish process of building the user interface for an application, so you can see how all of these techniques work in a real-world development scenario.",

Learn how to become more mindful of your strengths, limitations, and the values that define them; explore ways to create space between yourself, your thoughts, and your emotions; develop awareness of how people see the world differently based on individual preferences, as well as social and environmental factors; and use awareness of self and others to work toward collaboration, innovation, and mutually beneficial relationships. This course includes videos from: Daniel Goleman, psychologist, lecturer, and science journalist Amy Cuddy, social psychologist and associate professor at Harvard Business School Susan David, psychologist at Harvard Medical School and cofounder of the Institute of Coaching Alan Alda, Emmy-winning actor, writer, and director Angie McArthur, CEO of Professional Thinking Partners Note: This course was produced by Big Think.

In this course, Todd Perkins provides a structured guide to Java application development. He reviews the basic building blocks of the Java language: variables, functions, arrays, conditional statements, classes, and more. In chapters 3 and 4, he shows how to build a user interface with Swing, the UI toolkit for Java, and connect Swing table components to different data sources. He also covers distribution and deployment of Java applications via JAR files, server-side programming with JavaServer Pages (JSP), and the Android development workflow. By the end of the course, you should know the basics of Java and be able to create simple desktop, web, and mobile apps of your own.",

I can't find the source code for that. (It may be on a 3.5\" floppy somewhere here). Back then we didn't have the nice Swing tools, and had to do everything from scratch in code.<br /><br />We published runnable JAR files, including with resources, and installed Apache Tomcat and ran Java code from a .jsp page in our Web browser.<br />We ended up with installing Android Studio, based on IntelliJ IDEA, and created and ran a simple Android app. That was nice for me, since I'd only learned iOS development before.<br />In the bulk of the course, we used the Eclipse IDE and I found that its Code Completion is not as \"smart\" as other IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, as it completes method calls, but not variables. It does, however, also alert you and make it easy to import libraries that you use in code.",

      "comments": "OMG, what a wonderful course!<br />I started taking this instructor's Learning Bash Scripting course as a refresher, and he mentioned this course. I took a look, and saw that it covered using Visual Studio Code on Windows, with files on a WSL distribution.<br />We installed Windows Terminal, which offers tabs into PowerShell, the normal Windows Command Line, and WSL distro shells. We configured it to open to a default profile/shell, in my case to a Ubuntu 20.04 WSL instance.<br />Even though I have WSL version 2 installed, my distros were running in WSL 1 mode - we learned how to change them to running in WSL 2 mode.<br />WSL provides seamless file access between Windows and Linux environments, i.e., you have access to the files on both systems at the same time. So, for example, you can run Linux utilities, like awk and grep, etc. against the Windows filesystem.<br />The instructor had us install the Remote-WSL extension in Visual Studio Code - this gave us the ability to have a remote shell into the Linux environment, and create/edit and run scripts there, right from VS Code in Windows.<br />Now back to the Learning Bash Scripting course!",

While still in its infancy, blockchain technology demands attention. In this introductory-level course, learn what blockchain is and what it might mean to you. Jonathan Reichental—named one of the world's top 100 CIOs in 2017—dives into blockchain technology from a conceptual perspective. The course is primarily non-technical by design, intended for those working in business leadership positions, data science, and IT management.  Jonathan begins by describing some of the current challenges with the Internet, including existing risks and security problems such as identity management. Next, he describes how traditional online databases function, so that you have a basis for how the blockchain redesigns this function. He then describes how the blockchain becomes a potential solution for many of the existing limitations of online databases. Since the blockchain has its genesis in Bitcoin—the digital currency—he provides some background on that too. He also discusses how blockchain technology actually offers new capabilities beyond simply solving old problems. To wrap up the course, Jonathan shares steps you can take in your organization to understand the implications of the blockchain.",
